### 😎 About me

After a career in Biology, with a Ph.D. in Evolution of Biodiversity, I'm excited to be applying my passion for data analysis to a career in data science. My academic research at the PUCRS Vertebrate 
Systematics Laboratory honed my skills in statistics, data collection, analysis, and modeling. I'm adept at using R and Python for data exploration and visualization. I'm currently pursuing a degree in 
Data Analysis at PUCRS to further my skills and pursue a career transition into data science. I'm eager to combine my scientific background and data skills to contribute to projects that leverage data 
to solve meaningful problems.
